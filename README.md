Bunches of scripts I find useful. 
Running Notes:
  Run ./ScriptName to run a bash script
  For Alias.sh, run . ScriptName to run the script
    This is because ./ opens a new terminal session and runs the script there. 
    Temporarily sets up aliases
    Chose to do it this way so I don't forget my aliases.
